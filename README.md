## About The Project

Didow app is a final project for Bangkit 2022 program graduation requirement. Didow helps kids with dyslexia to learn to read and write in a fun way. With Didow, we will try to improve the learning progress and provides affordable assessment and treatment for children with dyslexia.

Here's why:
  * There are still rarely free applications that develop treatments for dyslexic children in Indonesia.
  * Of the 50 million school children in Indonesia, 5 million of them suffer from this disorder.
